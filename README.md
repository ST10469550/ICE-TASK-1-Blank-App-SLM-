APP GOAL
-The goal was to create a simple React Native component that greets the user by name, using input provided through a TextInput field. The initial challenge was ensuring the dynamic input updated correctly and rendered the greeting in real time.

RESOLUTION APPROACH
-To resolve promblem: app was not displaying Hello but only the user name

TO RESOLVE THIS
-I used the useState hook to store and manage the userâ€™s input.
-Bound the TextInput to userInput via value and onChangeText={setUserInput}, ensuring seamless state updates.
-Used a conditional Text element to display the message Hello, [username] only when input exists.
-Added a placeholder function handlePress() with a console.log() for potential future interaction expansion, such as triggering greetings on a button press or submission.

COULD NOT RESOLVE IT, THIS TIME THE CODE DID NOT RUN
